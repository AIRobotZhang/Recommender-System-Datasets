# Recommeder System Datasets 
This repository contains a list of public and compatible datasets, noting other major repositories containing newer, and popular real-world datasets that are available, along with reference of sample code for respective recomendation tasks. Most of the datasets presented are for non-commercial use by academics, for example faculty, university researchers and
other scientists. The datasets are free, however datasets may ask for citation. 
>In addition, there are a few links that may contain some sample code from existing works by their respective author. Before using these datasets, please review their sites and/ or **README** files for their respective usage licenses, acknowledgments and other details as a few datasets have additional citation requests.
